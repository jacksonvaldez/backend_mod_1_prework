## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I resonated with the fact that learning is a process, especially when it said "They don't have an end goal". I always assume I don't know anything or that there is always more to learn. I have an open mind to learning new things rather than assuming I know it all.

I think I need to start taking better care of my brain by getting exercise and eating better
