# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

print_name()

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  puts name
end

print_name("Albus Dumbledore")

# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in:
def sum(num1, num2)
  return num1 + num2
end

a = 5
b = 7
puts sum(4, 6)
puts sum(5 * 7, 6)
puts sum(a, b)

# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
# Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in.
def make_sentence (height_inches, age)
  return "I am #{height_inches} inches tall and #{age} years old"
end

 puts make_sentence(50, 5)

# PART 3: Naming is Hard
#-------------------


# Naming is notoriously hard in programming. It is a skill to name a variable or function concisely enough that it is reasonable to type, but descriptive enough that others can infer the meaning.

# Look at the code you wrote for the previous YOU DO🎈 - what did you name the function, and why?
# What did you name each parameter, and why?

# EXPLAIN:
# I named the function 'make_sentence' because that is what it does and its also returning a string (a sentence is a string)
# I gave it parameters of height_inches and age because it is using that criteria to make a sentence
